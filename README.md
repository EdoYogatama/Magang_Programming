# Python Dronekit
## About Dronekit and Compatibility
DroneKit-Python is an open source and community-driven project. DroneKit-Python allows developers to create apps that run on an onboard companion computer and communicate with the ArduPilot flight controller using a low-latency link. DroneKit-Python is compatible with vehicles that communicate using the MAVLink protocol (including most vehicles made by 3DR.

The API communicates with vehicles over MAVLink. It provides programmatic access to a connected vehicleâ€™s telemetry, state and parameter information, and enables both mission management and direct control over vehicle movement and operations.

## API Features
- Connect to a vehicle (or multiple vehicles) from a script
- Get and set vehicle state/telemetry and parameter information.
- Receive asynchronous notification of state changes.
- Guide a UAV to specified position (GUIDED mode).
- Send arbitrary custom messages to control UAV movement and other hardware (GUIDED mode).
- Create and manage waypoint missions (AUTO mode).
- Override RC channel settings
